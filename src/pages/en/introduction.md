**Welcome to Mariners (and the programming team, hopefully.)!**

This is the programming team docs site, including mandatory and non-mandatory materials. Fun project ideas to start on, and our team's library.
The site includes:

- ✅ **Full Markdown support**
- ✅ **Responsive mobile-friendly design**
- ✅ **Fake Search (i'm too lazy to implement)**
- ✅ (and, best of all) **dark mode**

## Getting Started

Head towards section 1 ( Syntax ) and read the document. 
Afterwards, head down towards the projects page, complete the mandatory missions and submit it.
