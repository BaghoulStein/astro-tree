A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. Or, in layman's terms, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

## Integer (int)

An integer is a numeric data type for whole numbers. For example:  ```-707, 0, 707, 23, 43213, -232.``` 

Integers can be derived to unisgned and signed numbers. Unsigned integers _cannot_ contain negative numbers, whereas signed integers _can_.


## Floating point (float)

A float is a numeric data type for numbers with fractions. For example:  ```123.2, 0.0, 5454.2, -232.4452.```

Floats are commonly written as 'doubles', which are floats that can store double the memory (and double the numbers) of regular floats.


## Character (char)

A char is a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, symbol, or blank space. For example: ```a, 1, !.```

Chars are the building blocks of the "string" data types.

## String (str)

A string is a sequence of characters, digits, or symbolsâ€”always treated as text. For example: ```"Hello World".``` 

Strings, in most languages, can be treated as Arrays.
