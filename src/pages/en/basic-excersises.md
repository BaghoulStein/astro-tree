It is expected that you write these as individual functions.

## If, Elif, and Else Excersises

1. Write a program that gets a number from the user (google!) and prints whether that number is positive or negative.<br>```Test Data :: Input number: 35 | Expected Output : Number is positive```

2. Write a program to solve quadratic equations (google how to raise numbers to a certian power) (using if, if else and else).<br>```Test Data :: Input A, B, C : 1, 5, 1 | Expected Output : Roots are -0.20871215252208009 and -4.7912878474779195```

3. Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number.<br>```Test Data :: Input number 25, 78, 87 || Expected Output : The greatest number is 87```

4. Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000. <br> ```Test Data :: Input Number : 25 || Expected Output : Input Value 25 Positive Number```

5. Write a Java program that keeps a number from the user and generates an integer between 1 and 7 and displays the name of the weekday. <br> ```Test Data :: Input Number : 3 || Expected Output : Wednesday```

## For and While Loops

1. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number.

2. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another. (Do not use Java built-in method)

3. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number.

4. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

5. Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user.
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n
