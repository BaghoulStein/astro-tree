In this page we go over basic python syntax, and some logic fallacies that need to be addressed.


## 1. Introdution to Python

For now, we will start off with Python due to it's simple syntax that's similar to English.

### 1.1 Hello World
To get started, invoke the interperter by writing ```Python``` in the terminal, and write the following line:<br><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 125%;"><span style="color: #85EA85"> ```Print```</span>```("Hello World")```</p>

...And congratulations on writing your first line of Python code.


### 1.2 Variables & Types

Python at it's core is a dynamically typed language, with static typing capabilities.
It consists of 4 primitive data types, and 4 non-primitive data types. 

The primitive data types are:
 * Integers (Whole numbers)
 * Floats (Decimal numbers)
 * Strings (Collections of alphabets, words or other characters)
 * Booleans (True or False values)

The non-primitive data types are:
 * Lists (Used to store collections of heterogeneous, mutable items)
 * Tuples (Used to store collections of heterogeneous, immutable items)
 * Dictionaries (Used to store collections of ```key : pair``` heterogeneous, mutable items)
 * Sets  (Used to store collections of unordered, unindexed, heterogeneous, immutable items)
