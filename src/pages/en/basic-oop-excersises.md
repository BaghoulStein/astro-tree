It is expected that you will write getters/setters for all classes.

1. Create a class for a circle that has a radius as it's only variable and the methods: getCircumference, getArea.
2. A class called Account, which models a bank account of a customer, is designed as shown in the following class diagram. The methods credit(amount) and debit(amount) add or subtract the given amount to the balance. The method transferTo(anotherAccount, amount) transfers the given amount from this Account to the given anotherAccount. Write the Account class.Create a class for a bank account that has a balance of 0.
